Willowshore Hinterlands and town map remakes. Isometric town map provided courtesy of @plasticmohawk on Discord, thank you!

This module currently only contains various forms of hexploration maps for the Willowshore Hinterlands:
- Normal Hinterlands map
- Including the Wall of Ghosts on the Hinterlands.
- Showing the boundaries of the Mindscape around the Hinterlands.
- Both the Wall of Ghosts and Mindscape borders.
- Book 2 variant of the Mindscape border, creating a tunnel along the Enlightened Path
- Book 3 winter variant of the Hinterlands if you want to show the region in a blizzard.
- Book 4/Late Book 3 variant of the Hinterlands extended east to include Karahai, Silkwasp Bandit Camp, and the Sea of Ghosts
- Book 4 map that's even more extended to the north and south as well. Includes the various locations for side quests in book 4 and some other homebrew locations of mine.
- Fog of War image for the extended Book 4 Spectrewood map. The Spectrewood scene should already have this fog of war configured, and the grid size aligned properly.

I recommend using this in conjuction with the [World Explorer](https://github.com/CarlosFdez/world-explorer) module to slowly reveal the borders of the mindscape as the players explore the boundary.

Troubleshooting Note:
If you see broken journal notes and missing tile images, it is because you do not have the official Season of Ghosts foundry module installed and imported. If you don't plan on using that module, then you can delete these broken tiles or journal notes out of the scene, because I cannot redistribute the images required for them. If you do use the premium module, make sure the Basis Pack is imported first, and then import my scenes, so it can point to the Player's Guide journal entries.

###
I've tried to capture as many details as I can without spoiling anything for the players. The various buildings and landmarks placed on the map should be known to the players at the start of the adventure.

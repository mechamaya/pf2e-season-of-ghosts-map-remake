This module currently only contains various forms of hexploration maps for the Willowshore Hinterlands:
- Normal Hinterlands map
- Including the Wall of Ghosts on the Hinterlands.
- Showing the boundaries of the Mindscape around the Hinterlands.
- Both the Wall of Ghosts and Mindscape borders.
- Book 2 variant of the Mindscape border, creating a tunnel along the Enlightened Path
- Book 3 winter variant of the Hinterlands if you want to show the region in a blizzard.
- Book 4/Late Book 3 variant of the Hinterlands extended east to include Karahai, Silkwasp Bandit Camp, and the Sea of Ghosts

I recommend using this in conjuction with the [World Explorer](https://github.com/CarlosFdez/world-explorer) module to slowly reveal the borders of the mindscape as the players explore the boundary.

I've tried to capture as many details as I can without spoiling anything for the players. The various buildings and landmarks placed on the map should be known to the players at the start of the adventure.

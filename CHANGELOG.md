# 0.9.4
Add map files for a new *further* extended Book 4 Hinterlands which adds locations north and south of the base map. This includes locations you travel to for side quests in book 4.
- Currently a WIP map, I might add polish and new locations in the coming weeks as I finish preparing my game for book 4. Importable foundry scene to come later.

# 0.9.3
Add map files for Book 4 Hinterlands that is extended east to show Karahai, the Silkwasp Camp, and the Sea of Ghosts. This would also work great for chapter 3 of book 3 going to Karahai.

# 0.9.2
Add map files for Book 3 Hinterlands that has snow on the ground and trees, and general wintery color desaturation.

# 0.9.1
Small fix to fix thumbnails

# 0.9.0

Initial release, contains variations of Willowshore Hinterlands and Town Map remakes. Isometric town map courtesy of @PlasticMohawk on discord, thank you!

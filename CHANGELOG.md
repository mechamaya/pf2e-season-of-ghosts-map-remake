# 1.1.0
Updated Spectrewood scene to be compatible with the newly added fog of war map that lines up specifically with the Spectrewood map.

# 1.0.1
v13 release, no changes, just verified v13 compatibility

# 1.0.0
- Fixes the Specterwood thumbnail image, and adjusts text labels on Specterwood and Hinterlands scenes.
- Various other fixes like removed module lock file, and set this to version 1.0 because I am not sure how much more I will be adding from here, I'm pretty happy with the Specterwood map as it is.

# 0.9.6
Updated Specterwood scene markers, and the map image has been updated with a new road to the south and some other minor adjustments.

# 0.9.5
Add scene for Extended Book 4 Hinterlands (Specterwood) map.

# 0.9.4
Add map files for a new *further* extended Book 4 Hinterlands which adds locations north and south of the base map. This includes locations you travel to for side quests in book 4.
- Currently a WIP map, I might add polish and new locations in the coming weeks as I finish preparing my game for book 4.

# 0.9.3
Add map files for Book 4 Hinterlands that is extended east to show Karahai, the Silkwasp Camp, and the Sea of Ghosts. This would also work great for chapter 3 of book 3 going to Karahai.

# 0.9.2
Add map files for Book 3 Hinterlands that has snow on the ground and trees, and general wintery color desaturation.

# 0.9.1
Small fix to fix thumbnails

# 0.9.0
